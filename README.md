# My-First-React-App
I am thrilled to share that I have successfully run my first "Hello World" application in React.js using the vs code terminal! 🚀💻

React.js is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it has gained immense popularity among developers worldwide. I wanted to dive into this technology, and I'm excited about the possibilities it offers.

Here's how I did it:

1️⃣ Set up my development environment by installing Node.js and npm.
2️⃣ Created a new React.js project using the terminal with the command: npx create-react-app hello-world.
3️⃣ Navigated to the project directory using the command: cd hello-world.
4️⃣ Modified the source code in src/App.js to display a "Hello, World!" message.
5️⃣ Started the development server with the command: npm start.
6️⃣ Accessed my application on http://localhost:3000 and saw the "Hello, World!" message rendered on the page. 🌍

This hands-on experience has given me a great introduction to React.js, and I'm eager to explore its features further. I can't wait to build more exciting projects with this amazing technology! 🚀✨
